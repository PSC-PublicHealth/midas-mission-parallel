    "# Parallelism in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does support multiple threads.  However, because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), this means that only one thread at a time can access any python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that without additional work (e.g., compiled extensions, Cython, f2py) we can't really use more than one CPU core at a time with python threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many common tasks do actually rely on compiled extensions that release the GIL (e.g., numpy), this doesn't help much for custom python code.  As we'll see below, the syntax used for multiprocessing and multithreading is similar enough that both can evaluated with very few code changes."
